# MultiCameraSystem-
The project utilizes multi-camera feeds and applies visual recognition and multi-camera geometry on them. 

## Important characteristics implemented:
1. Face Mask Detection
2. Person Detection
3. Heat Map Generation
4. Orthographic Generation
5. COVID-19 SOP Violation Detection
6. Visualizing Object Detections from Orthographic View

## Code Information:
basecode.py:                For live stream + recording live stream through multi-cameras.

basecode_mask_detection.py: For live stream + recording live stream through multi-cameras + live mask detection + recording live mask detection through multi-cameras.

Project_MaskDetection_
for_RecordedVids.ipynb:     For mask detection on recorded videos (much faster way than above file).
